## TODO:

- Update wp theme and add hostname there, so that no page refresh needed
- Check what left with Deployment
- Add init container that downloads proper plugin. Maybe later it will download theme. **Nice idea!**

## 18.11.2021

Done:

- configured deployments of application and database.
- Were able to setup WP inside K8s with multiple replicas
- !!! Found interesting behavior of Firefox when simply refreshing the page nothing changed!!!!!
